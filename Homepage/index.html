        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a motivated individual with a passion for continuous learning and personal growth. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, complemented by additional coursework in management, economics, and law. Furthermore, I am currently employed at Cyso and actively pursuing a traineeship in Development, where I can combine my passion for learning with my interest in technology. I thrive in dynamic environments, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute meaningfully to projects.

        <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a deep love for cats, which has led me to dedicate my summers as a volunteer at a local cat shelter for three years. This experience has reinforced my compassion, empathy, and commitment to making a positive impact in the community. In addition, with a background in dance at a professional level, I have cultivated discipline, perseverance, and the ability to work collaboratively as part of a team.</p>
